\section{Conclusion and Future Perspectives}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we presented three results from our study on understanding
deep effect handlers via the \shiftztt and dollar operators.
Specifically, we defined a pair of macro translations that add and remove
the return clause, derived a CPS translation for effect handlers from the
CPS translation for \shiftztt/dollar, and designed a type system for effect
handlers from the CPS translation.

As a continuation of this work, we intend to visit those challenges that
have been solved for \shiftztt and dollar (or reset) but not for effect
handlers.
One question we would like to investigate is whether effect handlers can 
fully express the CPS hierarchy~\cite{danvy-abstracting}.
The other question we are interested in is how to give an equational 
axiomatization~\cite{materzok-axiom} and a reflection~\cite{biernacki-stack}
of effect handlers.
By answering these questions, we would be able to discover novel 
tecnhiques for implementing, optimizing, and reasoning about effect 
handlers.

As an extension of our approach, we plan to study shallow effect
handlers~\cite{hillerstrom-shallow} by leveraging their connection to
the \controlztt and \promptztt operators~\cite{pirog-typedeq}.
These operators have a more complex semantics due to the absence of the
delimiter surrounding captured continuations, but we conjecture that it
is possible to establish similar results to what we have presented in this
paper.
