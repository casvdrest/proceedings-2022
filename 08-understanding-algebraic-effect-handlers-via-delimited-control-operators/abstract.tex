Algebraic effects and handlers are a powerful and convenient abstraction
for user-defined effects.
We aim to understand effect handlers through the lens of control 
operators, a similar but more well-studied tool for expressing effects.
In this paper, we establish two program transformations and a type system
for effect handlers, all by reusing the existing results about control
operators and their relationship to effect handlers.
